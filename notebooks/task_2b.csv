Farmed seafood is an important source of protein for food and feeds with a low-carbon footprint which has an important role to play in helping to build a sustainable food system. A strategic and long-term approach for the sustainable growth of a resilient EU aquaculture is, therefore, more relevant today than ever.


However, the efficient and cost-effective control of pathogens remains among the main challenges for the sector, particularly relevant for Europe, where there is a great variety of species and production systems, which hinders the implementation of good husbandry practices tailored to each aquatic species.


Through active engagement with key stakeholders, Cure4Aqua aims to jointly improve the resilience of EU aquaculture under environmental, biological, and socioeconomic stress, by improving aquatic animal health and welfare and supporting the environmentally friendly, inclusive, safe, and healthy production of seafood. Cure4Aqua will do so by:

- Developing cost-effective vaccines to prevent disease caused by 5 pathogens of economic significance to EU aquaculture.

- Identifying markers with diagnostic capacity to be integrated to selective breeding programs to improve stress and disease management.

- Developing innovative, biobased and sustainable solutions as an alternative to antibiotics for controlling fish pathogens at various life stages and alleviate the pressure of global antimicrobial resistance.

- Developing new tools and technology to improve health and welfare monitoring at the fish farm level and diagnostics of fish pathogens both at the laboratory and the fish farm levels.

- Placing fish welfare at the foreground of aquaculture production, through the development of high welfare standards that consider different life stages, production systems, and knowledge of welfare needs.

- Ensuring effective external communication, dissemination and exploitation of project activities and results to all relevant target groups.","Innovative Al Alloy For Aircraft Structural Parts using Additive Manufacturing Technology


The main goal of AlForAMA project is to develop an innovative High Strength Al alloy, feasible by powder metallurgy and suitable for Selective Laser Melting (SLM), with improved weldability and increased mechanical and corrosion resistance in comparison to cast grades Al alloys currently employed in Additive Manufacturing AM.


AlForAMA project is focused on powder bed based additive manufacturing AM of the innovative Al alloy. Selective Laser Melting SLM, which utilizes a laser as a thermal energy source to melt the powder, has been chosen as the preferred AM technology.


Development of the innovative aluminium alloy specifically designed for SLM will be mainly focused on two different aspects: on one hand, on tailoring the chemical composition to improve processability and/or mechanical response of well established commercial aluminium alloys and, on the other hand, on defining the specific PM processing of the raw powder material.


Raw materials for SLM, produced in a powder form, will be obtained by atomization process or, alternatively, by a mixing procedure of different starting powders.A suitable heat treatment will be defined for the developed innovative Al alloy after its SLM processing. To optimize thermal treatments AlForAMA project will consider the specific microstructural characteristics that SLM generates. SLM process development will be performed to ensure a defect free material manufacturing.


A deep characterization of the new material will be carried out including mechanical, chemical and corrosion aspects. Afterwards the manufacturing process will be validated at component level.


The AlForAMA project will be developed by a well balanced consortium that brings together 3 partners: the technical institutes LORTEK and IMDEA Spain and the university KU LEUVEN Belgium.","Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells wIth Enhanced Stability
 

The DESTINY initial training network will tackle major challenges in the development of stable dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC). DSC offers exciting possibilities for applications in building integrated photovoltaics and consumer electronics. However they possess a complex structure with disparate materials. For DSC to be marketable and to compete with its inorganic counterparts, fundamental science has to be done to understand the causes of degradation and find ways of enhancing cell and module life time and stability without sacrificing performance and scalability.
 

Ten internationally leading European research groups from six countries including Dyesol UK (part of Europe's leading industrial supplier of DSC), have joined forces as full participants with a commercial associated partner, combining expertise in synthetic chemistry, spectroscopy, nanoscale physics and device engineering. Our highly integrated approach to understanding degradation causes and proposing solutions will take a major step towards the commercialization of DSC. This consortium is strongly committed to promote breakthroughs at the frontiers of science and engineering.
 

The training dimension of DESTINY is reflected in the high priority we give to the training of early stage and experienced researchers (ESRs and ERs) through education and knowledge dissemination via Tutorial Courses, Annual Network Meetings, Training Schools, Conferences and Mobility Programmes. The network, with a strong focus on interdisciplinary training, builds on fruitful collaborations between the partners. Development of complementary skills presentation, management, technology transfer, IP protection will take place throughout the project lifetime. Interaction with stakeholders beyond those involved primarily in research will be maintained to enhance the international and societal dimension of our research and provide the wider community with information on this new technology.","Next generation solar active facade element Solar ventilation air preheater (SVAP)
 

Buildings are responsible for 40% of the energy consumption and 36% of CO2-emissions in the EU. According to Directive 2010/31/EU, all new buildings in the EU should be nearly-zero-energy buildings (NZEB) by the end of 2020. The amount of solar energy that is not collected from the facades contributes to CO2 emissions and the use of fossil fuel that could otherwise be avoided. Collecting solar energy from facades is a new and necessary trend in NZEB facades.
 

As a result of our &RD efforts, Saul’s Vjo Aruodai (SVA) has developed the patented Solar Ventilation Air Preheater (SVAP). SVAP’s heat exchanger construction solve the following problems that persist in the state-of-the-art products:

1. The regulation of the solar attack angle.

2. Minimizing the local and linear resistance of air movement inside the heat exchanger.

3. Maximizing the capture of solar radiation inside the heat exchanger.

4. Allowing the design of transparent modules because of the front and back slats construction.

5. Integrate photovoltaic modules on the front slats and capture thereflection of long infrared rays from the crystalline silicon cells.
 

Our product addresses a market that is worth over 10 BN EUR.This project will undertake a feasibility study, including a full business plan, to verify the technological, practical and economic viability of SVAP project in beachhead markets.","Spectrum of the planar AdSCFT correspondence
 

This project aims to formulate the full solution to the spectral problem of the planar AdS/CFT correspondence. This will be achieved in three steps. Firstly, I will subject the recently proposed set of spectral equations (TBA equations) for the planar AdS/CFT correspondence to extensive tests and, if necessary, modify them. Secondly, I will develop new powerful tools to facilitate the computation of the energies/dimensions of the physical states from the TBA equations. This should also give a handle on the origin of the underlying integrable structures. Finally, I will attempt to motivate the spectral equations for each of the constituent theories separately. This will furnish a proof of the planar AdS/CFT correspondence as far as the spectral problem is concerned and is expected to provide a profound insight into the dynamical degrees of freedom of the gauge and string theories.
 

The proposed research will significantly advance the state-of-the-art of the AdS/CFT correspondence and of exactly solvable quantum field theories.expected to provide a profound insight into the dynamical degrees of freedom of the gauge and string theories. The proposed research will significantly advance the state-of-the-art of the AdS/CFT correspondence and of exactly solvable quantum field theories.","OneDimensional WideBandgap Semiconductor Nanostructures: Analysis and Applications
 

Research and development in nanotechnology has seen astonishing progress during the past decade, and has now provided clearer indication of its potential. There is great potential to incorporate nanotechnology enabled products and services into almost all industrial sectors and medical fields by 2020. Resulting benefits will include increased productivity, more sustainable development, and new jobs.
 

To advance our scientific knowledge and to bring competitive advantage to the EU research and development in nanotechnology, PI proposes to investigate silicon carbide (SiC) and aluminum nitride (AlN) wide bandgap semiconductor nanostructures and develop new applications of these nanostructures for energy generation, optoelectronics, and sensing.
 

The proposed project is aimed not only to address the fundamental technical and scientific issues of 1D nanostructures, but also develop original products utilizing these materials. 1D AlN nanostructures are extremely important for many applications in several fields including power transistors, optoelectronics, heat sinks, resonators, sensors, and nanogenerators. Similarly, due to its inherent superior properties, SiC is an excellent material for applications in many areas including microelectronics (high temperature, high power, and high frequency), thermoelectrics, optoelectronics, and biomedical.
 

The specific research objectives are:

1. Full spectrum characterization of AlN nanostructures.

2. Development of AlN nanostructure based electricity generators nanogenerators.

3. Full spectrum characterization of SiC nanowires.

4. Fabrication of SiCnanowire devices for studying electrical, photoconductivity, and thermoelectric properties of the SiC nanowires.
 

The proposed project will significantly contribute to Europe's competitiveness in nanotechnology, since the project greatly overlaps with the EUHorizon 2020s specific objective and broad lines of activities for nanotechnology research, development, and education.","Balancing selection and the molecular evolution of mimicry supergenes


How genome organisation and architecture respond to variations in selection regimes is indeed poorly known at the microevolutionary scale. Supergenes are tight clusters of genes which simultaneously control the variation of various components of a complex trait, involving elements with different ontology. Supergenes typically evolve in response to strong epistatic selection between neighboring genes. They are usually maintained by some form of balancing selection, but the modalities of their evolution are still obscure and require empirical investigation. 
 

I propose to take advantage of the remarkable supergene controlling wing pattern mimicry balanced polymorphism in the tropical butterfly Heliconius numata to investigate the structure and evolution of supergenes at the molecular level. The supergene P is a positional homologue of a loose cluster of loci controlling wing pattern mimicry in a related species. Positional cloning revealed the supergene is situated in a local inversion. Recombination is largely suppressed around P and two groups of haplotypes segregate in perfect association with wing pattern in natural populations.
 

I propose to investigate the detailed structure of the inversion breakpoints and gene shuffling to test the working model of supergenes arising by rearrangement of distant ancestral loci. Using population genetics I propose to survey genetic diversity and look for signatures of balancing selection on the genes composing the supergene inversion. We will test for the effect of balancing selection in a patchy habitat, which has received little empirical data. We are now very close to genetically characterizing the major loci controlling spectacular adaptations, involved in speciation and radiations, and determining species coexistence.","Mechanisms of Protein SUMOylation and Its Functional Consequences
 

Protein posttranslational modification with small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO1, 2, and 3), also known as SUMOylation, targets a third of human proteins, is essential for organisms from yeast to humans, and has strong links to cancer and neurodegeneration. Like ubiquitylation, to which it is related, SUMOylation typically depends on the action of enzymes called E3 ligases, which help determine substrate specificity and the exact signal that is produced. However, while for ubiquitylation several hundred E3s are known, no more than two dozen SUMOspecific E3s have been described and only four characterized structurally in a way that reveals their mechanism.
 

Intriguingly, the SUMO E3 ligase activity keeps being detected in proteins that are unrelated to each other and sometimes can be mapped to apparent disordered regions. In the first part of this project, I will explore the poorly charted territory of SUMO writing by elucidating the structure and mechanism of some known SUMO E3 ligases for which the mechanism is unclear. This analysis will serve as a stepping stone to proposing computational, chemical biology, and structural biology approaches to identifying and characterizing new SUMO E3s.
 

In the second part, I will investigate downstream consequences of SUMOylation. Following attachment to a protein substrate, SUMOylation is thought to function as a molecular glue by promoting formation of protein complexes with specific SUMO readers, but detailed structural and biochemical information is lacking for any of such putative assemblies. To address this topic, I will develop strategies to identify and characterize SUMOdependent complexes.
 

The new tools, approaches, and knowledge about SUMO writing and reading will be broadly applicable to pathways regulated by SUMOylation, allowing their understanding in molecular and mechanistic terms. The study will also explore general concepts in protein evolution and evolutionary emergence of signaling systems.","Innovative sustainable ENCAPsulation systems for improving human HEALTH and wellbeing
 

Improvement and maintenance of health, particularly in ageing societies, is a major challenge defined in H2020. In this context, the objective of ENCAP4HEALTH is to develop innovative concepts for biopolymerbased microcapsules resulting in a new generation of highly functional delivery systems for functional food ingredients. Experts have emphasized for a long time that new methods and materials are required to improve functionality, digestibility and absorption of these socalled bioactives. With an increasing awareness for zerowaste production and reduction of the environmental impact of food processing, opportunities to create a new generation of encapsulation systems open up. ENCAP4HEALTH will bring together more than 50 international experts with ample expertise from 12 different institutions technical, medical and traditional universities, SMEs and multinational companies. The network aims to identify new biopolymers and to develop more efficient and sustainable processing technologies for encapsulation. The action is divided into six work packages, three of them devoted to scientific research and three to training, career development, dissemination and exploitation as well as management. Multiple training activities related to these work packages have been specifically designed to improve the skills of the consortium members and to promote their career development. Gender aspects will adequately be addressed in training and research. Exploitation of results will boost innovation and present societal and economic benefits by producing more effective functional food applying new and optimized encapsulation techniques. ENCAP4HEALTH will lead to a greater affordability of multiple health and food applications opening market opportunities in the food sector, that will spread out to agriculture, feed, pharma and even the biomedical sector.","Advanced Materials for Batteries
 

Li-ion technologies initiated in the 1990s at a fast development pace thanks mainly to emerging ICTs, with more than 20 GWh sold in 2010. Soon, it appeared as a credible technology for electrical vehicles as it could provide average energy densities of about 140 Wh/kg. However and since then,major breakthroughs have been expected to reach higher storage levels of 250 Wh/kg on battery system level with an acceptable lifetime of 3000 cycles in order to develop an affordable economical business plan for car batteries.
 

MAT4BAT builds up its EVs battery strategy on advanced materials and pilot line processes, proposing three novel concepts of cells initiating from a state-of-the-art combination of cell materials: NMC, Carbonate liquid electrolyte, and Graphite.
 

MAT4BAT will address all critical aging mechanisms associated with this technology, having direct impacts on product lifetime safety by implementing two work programs: Battery Assessment 1 and Battery Technologies 2.
 

Program 1 will set a framework to define critical charging modalities for a battery system during practical use and associated testing tools methods for relevant functional performance lifetime assessment. 

Within this framework, the Program 2 will implement three generations of cells with a focus on electrolytes which will be steadily transformed from Liquid to Gel to AllSolid state electrolytes in order to promote substantial gain in cell lifetime and safety by preventing degradations and hazards and improving energy density with a separator-free cell with an all-solid state electrolyte.
 

100 state-of-the-art commercial cells will be assessed to define normal and critical charge/discharge conditions of testing with appropriate testing protocols. Besides,materials increments will be screened out on coin-cells prior to a benchmarking of most promising materials at full cells level.
 

Eventually,1040 A.h prototypes will be produced to validate MAT4BAT’s best technologies against quantified objectives.","Endoscopic stenting for colorectal cancer obstruction as a bridgetosurgery strategy
 

Acute obstructive colorectal cancer requires prompt decompression commonly by emergency surgery (ES). However, self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) have been increasingly used as a bridge-to-surgery (BTS) strategy.","Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy in Patients with Large Adrenal Tumors
 

Objectives: The maximum size of adrenal tumors that should be removed by laparoscopic adrenalectomy is controversial. We conducted a retrospective comparison of the results of laparoscopic adrenalectomy between patients with adrenal tumors >6cm (large tumors) and patients with adrenal tumors","Silencing of cmyc Expression in Tumor Cells by siRNA 


Suppression of c-myc proto-oncogene expression in KB31 cells by siRNA was investigated. The siRNA duplex targeted to the exon 3 of c-myc mRNA was prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase on short dsDNA templates. It was found that incubation of KB31 cells in the presence of 75 nM siRNA results in decrease of the c-myc mRNA level down to 5% of the level in the control cells and significant decline of KB31 cell proliferation rate. Using 200 nM siRNA fourfold decrease of KB31 cells proliferation rate was observed and this effect was stable at least 96 hours after transfection.","Expression of T-Lymphoma Invasion and Metastasis Factor on the occurrence of oral squamous cell carcinoma.
 

In recent years, many studies have found that tumor metastasis-related gene T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis-inducing factor 1 (TIAM1) had abnormal high expression in a variety of tumor cells; however, there are few studies regarding its expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
 

This study aimed to observe the expression of TIAM1 in OSCC and investigated its clinical significance. The expression of TIAM1 in tissues from 120 cases of OSCC and oral mucosa from 40 normal cases was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the relationship between the expression of TIAM1 and the clinicopathological parameters of OSCC was analyzed. The positive expression rate of TIAM1 in the OSCC tissues was significantly higher than that in the normal oral mucosa (92.5% vs 0). 

With the decrease of histological differentiation of OSCC, the increase of tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, and the occurrence of lymph node metastasis, the TIAM1 staining positive rate was gradually increased, and the difference was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). 
 

However, the expression of TIAM1 in the OSCC tissues was in no correlation with the gender and age of the patients. The expression of TIAM1 is closely related to the occurrence, development and metastasis of OSCC, and it can be used as a new marker for reflecting its biological behaviors.","Adhesive Factin Waves: A Novel IntegrinMediated Adhesion Complex Coupled to Ventral Actin Polymerization
 

At the leading lamellipodium of migrating cells, protrusion of an Arp2/3-nucleated actin network is coupled to formation of integrin-based adhesions, suggesting that Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization and integrin-dependent adhesion may be mechanistically linked. Arp2/3 also mediates actin polymerization in structures distinct from the lamellipodium, in ventral F-actin waves that propagate as spots and wavefronts along the ventral plasma membrane.
 

Here we show that integrins engage the extracellular matrix downstream of ventral F-actin waves in several mammalian cell lines as well as in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These adhesive F-actin waves require a cycle of integrin engagement and disengagement to the extracellular matrix for their formation and propagation, and exhibit morphometry and a hierarchical assembly and disassembly mechanism distinct from other integrin-containing structures.
 

After Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization, zyxin and VASP are corecruited to adhesive F-actin waves, followed by paxillin and vinculin, and finally talin and integrin. Adhesive F-actin waves thus represent a previously uncharacterized integrin-based adhesion complex associated with Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization.","Multipolar Mitosis and Aneuploidy after Chrysotile Treatment: A Consequence of Abscission Failure and Cytokinesis Regression
 

Chrysotile, like other types of asbestos, has been associated with mesothelioma, lung cancer and asbestosis. However, the cellular abnormalities induced by these fibers involved in cancer development have not been elucidated yet.
 

Previous works show that chrysotile fibers induce features of cancer cells, such as aneuploidy, multinucleation and multipolar mitosis.
 

In the present study, normal and cancer-derived human cell lines were treated with chrysotile and the cellular and molecular mechanisms related to generation of aneuploid cells was elucidated.
 

The first alteration observed was cytokinesis regression, the main cause of multinucleated cells formation and centrosome amplification. The multinucleated cells formed after cytokinesis regression were able to progress through cell cycle and generated aneuploid cells after abnormal mitosis.
 

To understand the process of cytokinesis regression, localization of cytokinetic proteins was investigated. It was observed mislocalization of Anillin, Aurora B, Septin 9, and Alix in the intercellular bridge, and no determination of secondary constriction and abscission sites.
 

Fiber treatment also led to overexpression of genes related to cancer, cytokinesis and cell cycle. 
 

The results show that chrysotile fibers induce cellular and molecular alterations in normal and tumor cells that have been related to cancer initiation and progression, and that tetraploidization and aneuploid cell formation are striking events after fiber internalization, which could generate a favorable context to cancer development.","PIK3CA Mutation Uncouples Tumor Growth and Cyclin D1 Regulation from MEK/ERK and Mutant KRAS Signaling
 

Mutational activation of KRAS is a common event in human tumors. Identification of the key signaling pathways downstream of mutant KRAS is essential for our understanding of how to pharmacologically target these cancers in patients.
 

We show that PD0325901, a small-molecule MEK inhibitor, decreases MEK/ERK pathway signaling and destabilizes cyclin D1, resulting in significant anticancer activity in a subset of KRAS mutant tumors in vitro and in vivo.
 

Mutational activation of PIK3CA, which commonly cooccurs with KRAS mutation, provides resistance to MEK inhibition through reactivation of AKT signaling. Genetic ablation of the mutant PIK3CA allele in MEK inhibitor-resistant cells restores MEK pathway sensitivity, and reexpression of mutant PIK3CA reinstates the resistance, highlighting the importance of this mutation in resistance to therapy in human cancers. In KRAS mutant tumors, PIK3CA mutation restores cyclin D1 expression and G1/S cell cycle progression so that they are no longer dependent on KRAS and MEK/ERK signaling.
 

Furthermore, the growth of KRAS mutant tumors with coexistent PIK3CA mutations in vivo is profoundly inhibited with combined pharmacologic inhibition of MEK and AKT. These data suggest that tumors with both KRAS and phosphoinositide 3-kinase mutations are unlikely to respond to the inhibition of the MEK pathway alone but will require effective inhibition of both MEK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway signaling.","SMAC Negatively Regulates the Antiapoptotic Activity of Melanoma Inhibitor of Apoptosis (MLIAP)
 

Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) physically interact with a variety of proapoptotic proteins and inhibit apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli. X-linked IAP (XIAP) is a prototype IAP family member that inhibits several caspases, the effector proteases of apoptosis. The inhibitory activity of XIAP is regulated by SMAC, a protein that is processed to its active form upon receipt of a death stimulus. Cleaved SMAC binds XIAP and antagonizes its antiapoptotic activity.
 

Here we show that melanoma IAP (MLIAP), a potent anti-cell death protein and caspase inhibitor, physically interacts with SMAC through its BIR (baculovirus IAP repeat) domain. In addition to binding full-length SMAC, MLIAP BIR associates with SMAC peptides that are derived from the amino terminus of active, processed SMAC. This high affinity interaction is very specific and can be completely abolished by single amino acid mutations either in the amino terminus of active SMAC or in the BIR domain of MLIAP.
 

In cells expressing MLIAP and XIAP, SMAC co-expression or addition of SMAC peptides abrogates the ability of the IAPs to inhibit cell death. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using SMAC peptides as a way to sensitize IAPexpressing cells to pro-apoptotic stimuli such as chemotherapeutic agents.","Radiolanthanide-Labeled Monoclonal Antibody CC49 for Radioimmunotherapy of Cancer: Biological Comparison of DOTA Conjugates and 149Pm, 166Ho, and 177Lu
 

The radiolanthanides 149Pm, 166Ho, and 177Lu have decay characteristics suitable for radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of cancer. N-Hydroxysulfosuccinimidyl DOTA (DOTA-OSSu) and methoxy-DOTA (MeO-DOTA) were conjugated to the anti-TAG72 monoclonal antibody CC49 for radiolabeling with 149Pm, 166Ho, and 177Lu.
 

While both DOTA conjugates could be labeled to high specific activity with 177Lu, MeO-DOTA afforded superior conjugate stability, radiolabeling, and radiochemical purity. Pilot bio-distributions in nude mice bearing LS174T human colon carcinoma xenografts demonstrated that MeO-DOTA afforded higher tumor uptake and lower kidney retention of 177Lu than DOTA-OSSu.
 

The in vitro stability of 149Pm, 166Ho, and 177Lu-MeO-DOTA-CC49 was evaluated using serum and hydroxyapatite assays. Serum stability of radiolanthanide-labeled MeO-DOTA-CC49 followed a trend based on the coordination energies of the radiometals, with 177Lu showing the highest stability after 96 to 168 h at 37°C. In contrast, MeODOTACC49 labeled with all three radiolanthanides was 92 stable to hydroxyapatite challenge for 168 h at 37°C.
 

Comprehensive bio-distributions of 149Pm, 166Ho, and 177Lu-MeO-DOT-ACC49 were obtained in LS174T-bearing nude mice. Maximum tumor uptakes were 100.0 ID/g for 149Pm at 96 h, 69.5 ID/g for 166Ho at 96 h, and 132.4 ID/g for 177Lu at 168 h. Normal organ uptakes were generally low, except in the liver, spleen, and kidney at early time points. By 96 to 168 h post-injection, nontarget organ uptake decreased to approximately 7 ID/g kidney, 12 ID/g spleen, and 20 ID/g liver for each radiolanthanide. When labeled with 149Pm, 166Ho, and 177Lu, MeO-DOTA-CC49 has potential for RIT of colorectal cancer and other carcinomas.","Colorectal Cancer-targeted Delivery of Oxaliplatin via Folic Acid-grafted Solid Lipid Nanoparticles: Preparation, Optimization, and in Vitro Evaluation 
 

Abstract Objective: Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranked second in females and third in males among all types of cancers diagnosed. About 1.4 million cases took place with 693,900 deaths in 2012. It can occur either in colon or rectum. Thus, we aimed to develop and optimize oxaliplatin OP loaded solid lipid nanoparticles SLNs.
 

Materials and methods: SLNs containing tristearin, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE), Lipoid S75, and Tween 80 was developed. BoxBehnken design was applied for optimization of SLNs and optimized formulation was selected for conjugation with folic acid (FA). Optimized formulations were evaluated for various physio-chemical parameters viz., particle size (PS), zeta potential, entrapment efficiency (EE), morphology, Xray diffraction (XRD), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
 

Results and discussion: OP loaded uncoupled SLNs (OP-SLNs) and OP loaded FA coupled SLNs (OP-SLNFs) formulations revealed good EE (49.2+-0.38 and 43.5+-0.59, respectively) and small PS (146.2+-4.4 nm, and 158.8+-5.6 nm, respectively). XRD pattern and DSC results confirmed that OP was uniformly distributed in amorphous form within SLNs. In vitro drug release study of OPSLNs and OPSLNFs formulation revealed sustained drug release patterns of OP for up to 6 d. Anticancer activity on HT29 cell line indicated the highest potency of OPSLNFs as compared to OPSLNs and OP solution. 
 

Conclusion: The present work illustrated the higher sensitivity of HT29 cells to the drug entrapped in OPSLNFs as compared to OPSLNs and OP solution. Hence, this novel strategy might be a promising approach for the management of CRC.","Blog Track Research at TREC
 

The TREC Blog track aims to explore information seeking behavior in the blogosphere, by building reusable test collections for blog-related search tasks. Since its advent in TREC 2006, the Blog track has led to much research in this growing field, and encapsulated crosspollination from natural language processing research.
 

This paper recaps on the tasks addressed at the TREC Blog track thus far, covering the period 2006-2009. In particular, we describe the used corpora, the tasks addressed within the track, and the resulting published research.","Investigating Parody from Social Media Accounts
 

Parody is a widespread comic on different social media platforms. As the usage of social media increases, the number of parody accounts increases as well. The main purpose of parody accounts is to spread fake news or to criticize someone in comic ways.
 

In this paper, we investigate parody for different social media accounts. For this study, a customized tweets dataset is created related to different Pakistani personalities and companies. The experiment is carried out using different machine learning and deep learning methods. Our results indicate an accuracy of 92% using RoBERTa.","The Distributed Ontology Language DOL: Use Cases, Syntax, and Extensibility



The Distributed Ontology Language DOL is currently being standardized within the OntoIOp Ontology Integration and Interoperability activity of ISOTC 37SC 3. It aims at providing a unified framework for ontologies formalized in heterogeneous logics, modular ontologies, links between ontologies, and annotations of ontologies. This paper presents the current state of DOL’s standardization. It focuses on use cases where distributed ontologies enable interoperability and reusability. We demonstrate relevant features of the DOL syntax and semantics and explain how these integrate into existing knowledge engineering environments.","Towards Harnessing Natural Language Generation to Explain Blackbox Models
 

The opaque nature of many machine learning techniques prevents the wide adoption of powerful information processing tools for high stakes scenarios. The emerging field eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims at providing justifications for automatic decision-making systems in order to ensure reliability and trustworthiness in the users.
 

To achieve this vision, we emphasize the importance of a natural language textual modality as a key component for a future intelligent interactive agent. We outline the challenges of XAI and review a set of publications that work in this direction.","Power System Restoration Using Multilayer Perceptron
 

In recent years, power systems are being operated nearer to their limits due to economic competition and deregulation. Also, nowadays the challenge is to include large and ever increasing amounts of decentralized generated power into the existing transmission network and at the same time comply with the electricity market transmission demands. Both factors increase the risk of blackout. After which, power needs to be restored as quickly and reliably as possible and, accordingly, detailed power system restoration plans are required. The multilayer perceptron network is chosen for a more precise examination.","Risk Factor Analysis combined with Deep Learning in the Risk Assessment of Overseas Investment of Enterprises 
 

To evaluate the overseas investment risks of enterprises and expand the application and development of deep learning methods in risk assessment, 15 national clusters are utilized as samples to analyze and discuss the overseas investment risk indicators of enterprises. 
 

First, based on the indicator system of overseas investment risks, five major types of investment risks are identified. 

Second, the Deep Neural Network DNN is introduced; a risk evaluation model is constructed for enterprise overseas investment. 

Finally, the investment attractiveness index in the Fraser risk assessment learning label is adopted as the evaluation results of the model. According to the classification of risks, the model is trained and its performance is tested.
 

The results show that the major source of overseas investment risks includes basic resources, political systems, economic and financial development, and environmental protection. The corresponding risk score is high. North American country clusters and Oceanian country clusters have lower investment risks, while the investment risks in Africa, Latin America, and Asia are affected by multiple factors of the specific cities. This is closely related to the resources and legal systems possessed by the country clusters. This is of great significance for enterprises to conduct risk assessment in overseas investment.","Classification of News Articles using Gradient Boosting based Deep Learning Model
 

The Newspaper articles offer us insights into several news in todays world. With the popularization of the internet, people are directly influenced by the content they surf on the internet in their daily life and online news is not an exception. It necessitates the need to classify such news articles for its readily availability.
 

In this paper we propose a novel method named Long short term memoryGradient boosting (LSTM-GB) deep learning model for classification of news articles and compare the result with existing traditional classifiers. Furthermore, the proposed model attains 99.8 accuracy which outplays other classifiers.","The Roles of Network Communities in Social Information Diffusion
 

Online social connections allow users to share and spread information with others. Different users play various roles on information diffusion: some are influential within a community and some make information widely spread across communities. This paper aims to unveil the hidden relationships between nodes and information diffusion in the context of communities from the big Twitter diffusion data with a million-scale social network, as a complement to existing link-based diffusion analysis e.g. the strength of weak ties. We identify six types of well-known community-aware roles of nodes, and examine their diffusion capability on propagating information within/across communities, using information flows via retweets and mentions in Twitter. We find nodes acting as community bridges are exposed to more information and more dominative on spreading information within/across communities. Community-aware roles are also validated via supervised learning to be effective for detecting the most diffusive information propagators.","Voltage Control of PM Synchronous Motor Driven PM Synchronous Generator System Using Recurrent Wavelet Neural Network Controller
 

In this paper the two novel recurrent wavelet neural network (RWNN) controllers are proposed for controlling output direct current (DC) voltage of the rectifier and output alternate current (AC) voltage of the inverter. The output power of the rectifier and the inverter is provided by threephase permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) system directly driven by permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM).  Firstly, the field-oriented mechanism is implemented for controlling output of the PMSG system. Then, one RWNN controller is developed for controlling the rectifier to convert AC voltage into DC link voltage and the other RWNN controller is implemented for controlling the inverter to convert DC link voltage into AC line voltage. Moreover, two online trained RWNNs using backpropagation learning algorithms are developed for regulating both the DC link voltage of the rectifier and the AC line voltage of the inverter. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed two RWNN controllers are demonstrated in comparison with the two PI controllers from some experimental results.","Advanced Genetic Operators and Techniques: An Analysis of Dominance Diploidy, Reordering Operator in Genetic Search
 

The paper explains use of low level advanced Genetic Algorithm operator DOMINANCE DIPLOIDY for getting new binary string structure in terms of heterozygous or homozygous expression of dominant recessive alleles. It also highlights the role of schema representation, physical schema and expressed schema on population size, as an attempt to improve upon the robustness of simple GAs. The paper has demonstrated a numerical pattern of selection of dominant and recessive alleles. It has suggested numerically the probability of gene movement and gene disruption for various REORDERING OPERATORS LIKE INVERSION, CYCLE CROSSOVER, and order crossover etc. Theory of reordering operator is tested and verified upon string schema representation. Thus the paper aims to analyze the advanced genetic operators and techniques in GA search.",PROLIFIC_PID
