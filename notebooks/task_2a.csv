CHANCES aims at combining and integrating ongoing cohort studies in order to produce evidence on aging related health characteristics and determinants in Europe, and their socioeconomic implications.
- 15 cohorts participate, covering populations from 18 EU Member States, 4 associate countries, and 3 additional countries. 
- The combination of these different studies would lead to an integrated approach to the study of health in the elderly. 


CHANCES will address 5 main types of health related characteristics: 1) Incidence of chronic conditions, disabilities and mortality; 2) Prevalence of chronic conditions and disabilities; 3) Health-related determinants of chronic conditions and disabilities; 4) Aging-related characteristics as determinants of chronic condition, disabilities and mortality; and 5) Social and economic implications of chronic conditions, disabilities and mortality in the elderly.


Analyses will be conducted in subjects aged 50-59, 60-69 and 70 years. Health-related determinants comprise:
- Socioeconomic factors (e.g., education, income)
- Environmental factors (e.g., occupational exposures)
- Lifestyle factors (e.g., tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking)
- Nutritional factors (e.g., BMI, dietary patterns), in addition to biomarkers and genetic factors. 


4 major groups of chronic conditions and disabilities will be studied: Cancer, Diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, Fractures and osteoporosis, Cognitive function and Alzheimer disease.

Information on other conditions and disabilities (e.g., eye diseases, chronic respiratory conditions) will be also collected if available. Mortality will be assessed in terms of age-specific rates as well as DALYs. A health module will be developed, to be applied to other population surveys. Additionally, the study will generate a unique resource for additional studies on health and its determinants in the elderly. Provisions will be made to allow for this work to be extended.","Functional Biomarkers as in vitro diagnostic tools for managing patients with chronic disease
 

The aim of this proposal is to establish a business plan for the development of a new class of Functional Biomarkers as in vitro diagnostic tools for managing patients with chronic disease. 
 

The proof of concept will be established by focusing on substrates of the Xprolyl dipeptidyl peptidase DPP, a family of pleiotropic enzymes that cleave the Nterminal two amino acids of proteins. There are 30 known substrates for DPPIV, the best characterized member of this family. 
 

Importantly the catalytic activity of DPPIV results in the conversion of agonist ligands into antagonist or nonfunctional proteins.
 

In the context of our funded ERC project, we have provided the first in vivo evidence of DPPIVmediated cleavage of the chemokine interferon induced protein 10 IP10 or CXCL10 (Casrouge, JCI 2011). These initial observations have recently been validated, conclusively demonstrating the ability to predict treatment failure in chronic HCV patients (p-value 0.001 for antagonist CXCL10 and negative predictive value 93.5).

Based on the important role of DDPIV in disease pathogenesis and following from our findings, there are two ideas that we wish to develop further as proof of concept for Functional Biomarkers in the management of patients. 
 

First, we wish to evaluate the market needs for developing a privately run SME, aimed at providing theragnostic testing useful for stratification of chronic HCV patients. We will also examine the potential value of applying these in vitro diagnostic IVD tools in other disease settings in which DPPIV and/or CXCL10 have been identified as a predictive biomarker. Second, we aim to extend our repertoire of assays to include other disease relevant DPPIV substrates.","Information-Theoretic approach to Infer Encoding Patterns in a Decision-Making Process
 

The question of how stimuli and actions are encoded in the neuronal signals of the brain is at the central core of neuroscience research. In particular, very little is known about the mechanism for which a given decision posterior to a stimulus is manifested in the brain activity.
 

Nowadays, simultaneous recordings of neurons in different brain regions bring an exceptional dataset to investigate the complex encoding mechanisms that underlie a decision making process. In the present project, the candidate will have exclusive access to one of these datasets which consists of brain recordings in primates during a decision making task.
 

The candidate will employ his expertise in some areas of information theory and coding to formulate a novel hypothesis to be tested on these available data. This hypothesis states that causal interactions between neurons in a population encode information about decisions.
 

This interdisciplinary line of investigation represents a changing point in the candidate's career. On one hand, the candidate will be trained in the neurophysiological aspects of the problem. On the other hand, he will develop emerging methods to capture causal interactions between neuronal responses and then represent the hypothesized encoding patterns.
 

From a scientific point of view, this project will provide one of the key tools to understand information processing in a decision-making process and study sources of brain disorder based on the dynamics of encoding patterns.
 

More generally, the present project will launch the candidates career in an interdisciplinary field that has potential application in academia and industry research, as well as will foster the collaboration between the information theory and the computational neuroscience communities, thus making this research area in Europe more competitive and attractive for future students and researchers.","Bacteriophages, Phage-host Interactions, and Evolution of Defense Mechanisms in Beneficial Bacterium Propionibacterium freudenreichii
 

Bacteriophages (phages) infecting Propionibacterium freudenreichii, a bacterium known for production of active vitamin B12 and for causing well documented benefits to human health, are more diverse than those identified for closely related genera. At the same time, the defense mechanisms protecting the bacterial strains hosts from phage attacks are more diverse as well. These two phenomena suggest 

that P. freudenreichii strains and their phages have experienced complex interactions in phage-bacterium arms race.
 

However, both phages attacking and the defense mechanisms that this important food-grade Actinobacterium uses to protect itself from phage attacks are currently severely understudied. In CODEfENDENCE, I will use an innovative approach of systematic study of the defense mechanisms not only from the perspective of the bacterium, but also from the perspective of the phage.
 

The use of strains and phages isolated from samples of different origin will ensure diversity of material subjected to analyses by a combination of phenotypic, genomic, proteomic and imaging methods. This multidisciplinary approach is possible due to guidance offered by world-class phage specialists at one of the world’s top universities, the University of Copenhagen.
 

The expected result of CODEfENDENCE is elucidation of complex interactions between P. freudenreichii and its phages, which led to the high diversity of the phages and the multitude of defense mechanisms employed by the strains. As an added benefit, these results have a great potential for being translated into novel genetic tools and to aid the development of phage therapies, especially those aimed at pathogenic Actinobacteria.","Macroeconomic Dynamics with Product Market Frictions


The transmission of microeconomic and macroeconomic shocks to firms' price and demand in product markets is the cornerstone of a large volume of macroeconomic literature. Product market frictions, by reducing the ability of demand to relocate across different suppliers, affect firms incentives when setting prices, and therefore the passthrough of shocks to both demand and prices.
 

In this project we plan to study the implications of product market frictions for firm level price and demand dynamics, as well as for macroeconomic dynamics. The aim is to integrate micro and macro economics, both theoretically and empirically, to a greater extent than is currently done in the literature.
 

We will apply our tools to two main areas of interest.

First, we will study how product market frictions affect the optimal pricing decision of firms, and the relocation of consumers across different suppliers. We will provide novel empirical microeconomic evidence on the relationship between price and consumer dynamics. We will build a rich but yet tractable model where product market frictions give rise to firm pricing with customer markets. The aim is to use observable statistics from the micro data to estimate the key parameters of the model and quantify the relevance of the product market frictions for firm pricing and demand dynamics. 
 

Second, we will explore the importance of product market frictions for macroeconomic dynamics. We will apply our quantified model of price and consumer dynamics to areas of macroeconomics where we expect our methodology and empirical analysis to be more relevant, both because of the types of questions addressed and because of a direct relationship with the mechanism. In particular we will focus on the role of product market frictions for business cycle fluctuations and international trade.","Perception of Other Religions
 

The aim of the research project is to provide an extensive analysis of the perception of other religions and their members by Christian authors of the Early and High Middle Ages from the fifth to the twelfth centuries. For the first time ever, the medieval perception of heathens, Jews, Muslims, heretics and Orthodox Christians, as they are seen by Occidental Catholics, is explored in a comparative and comprehensive manner. 
 

The project, therefore, will provide an invaluable contribution to religious thinking, the understanding of religion, the concept of the other and the religious concept of self.","Condensation in designed systems



Quantum coherent phenomena, especially macroscopic quantum coherence, are among the most striking predictions of quantum mechanics. They have lead to remarkable applications such as lasers and modern optical technologies, and in the future, breakthroughs such as quantum information processing are envisioned. Macroscopic quantum coherence is manifested in BoseEinstein condensate (BEC), superfluidity, and superconductivity, which have been observed in a variety of systems and continue to be at the front-line of scientific research.



Here my objective is to extend the realm of BoseEinstein condensation into new conceptual and practical directions. I focus on the role of a hybrid character of the object that condenses and on the role of nonequilibrium in the BEC phenomenon. The work is mostly theoretical but has also an experimental part.
 

I study two new types of hybrids, fundamentally different from each other. First, I consider pairing and superfluidity in a mixed geometry. Experimental realization of mixed geometries is becoming feasible in ultracold gasses. Second, I explore the possibility of finding novel hybrids of light and matter excitations that may display condensation. 
 

By combining insight from these two cases, my goal is to understand how the hybrid and nonequilibrium nature can be exploited to design desirable properties, such as high critical temperatures. In particular, in case of the new lightmatter hybrids, the goal is to provide realistic scenarios for, and also experimentally demonstrate, a room temperature BEC.","Deformations of fundamental Groups of REpresentATions


The aim of this project is to consider X a smooth projective algebraic curve and a representation of 1X into a semisimple Lie group G, and study deformations of when X deforms into a singular curve. This question will open a brand new direction in the theory of representations of fundamental groups and G-Higgs bundles.
 

The main tool to approach the problem will be non abelian Hodge theory to transform this topological question into the geometric one. Then we use recent new developments in the classification of representations together with new algebraic objects which recently appeared in nonabelian Hodge theory to study this question. It will take us to the study of the deformations of G-Higgs bundles together with deformations of harmonic bundles over X when X is a curve and varies.
 

This project will allow the researcher to broaden her area of expertise as well as to develop new directions in her research lines. She will complement her knowledge in differential geometry in one of the most prestigious Universities and under the guidance of one of the worldwide leaders in this field.","Mythical Discourse and Religious Agency in the Puranic Ecumene
 

The Puranas, Primordial Texts, constitute the most voluminous and enduring genre of Sanskrit literature. These anonymous texts narrate the mythic cycles associated with the major deities of Hinduism - Visnu, Siva, Brahma, the Goddess, etc..
 

The Puranas have also been integral to processes of placemaking by creating maps of geography and celebrating the salvific potential of sacred sites in myths that imbue the landscape with divine agency.
 

While many important Puranas were first recorded and circulated in the first millennium CE - a time of significant social change marked by the flourishing of regional devotional movements and innovations of temple and image-centered religious practices, the genre has remained a living tradition through the colonial period until the present day.
 

Despite the traditions centrality for cultural production in South Asia, we know very little about their historical embeddedness, as the Puranic composers and transmitters - in accordance with the anonymity characteristic of the genre - disguised their own historicity behind claims of primordiality and divinely inspired teachings. More than just a body of literature, the Puranas are a dynamic mythical discourse.
 

PURANA makes a critical intervention in the field by tracing the composition, transmission, translation, and agency of the Puranas as a transregional and transhistorical process involving multiple actors, audiences, and geographic contexts - from Hindu scribes and Persian poets to Portuguese Jesuits and Khmer rulers.
 

Adopting a longue dure perspective, we argue that the Puranas mythical discourse underlies and unites the religio-political culture of the Sanskrit Cosmopolis - establishing what we call a Puranic Ecumene: a vast part of the inhabited premodern world united by a distinctive mythical discourse, a hegemonic vision of the integration of society and cosmos, and a remarkable way of anchoring the present in the continuing ancient past.","Going from Phenomenal to Access Consciousness: Neurobehavioral Correlates of Visual Consciousness Development and Its Underlying Cognitive Processes.



The concept of visual consciousness is notoriously hard to define. According to Block (1996), visual consciousness, rather than being unitary, is an hybrid theoretical construct that includes at least two discernible concepts:- Phenomenal or P-consciousness, which represents the experiential properties of our perceptions, and
- Access or A-consciousness, which refers to the availability of part of the visual information for use in reasoning and rationally driven action.



Intriguingly, according to Lamme (2003), the two types of consciousness can be linked to different stages of visual information processing. Specifically, P-consciousness is related to the iconic memory content of the original visual experience, while A-consciousness is associated with the working memory content of a surviving piece of the original experience, after different processing stages.
 

The route from P- to A-consciousness (P- to A-Cons) involves several cognitive processes, such as attention, memory, decision-making and metacognition, which are intermingled and spatiotemporally overlapped. This route emerges from the activity of multiple neurons interconnected by local visual and global frontoparietal brain networks.
 

Despite that in the last years significant progress has been made on the knowledge of the brain circuits of visual consciousness, its precise functional organization and neural dynamics are still largely unknown.
 

The present project aims to scan the spatiotemporal evolution of visual consciousness, by combining psychophysical measures, MEG recordings and patient studies. More concretely, it attempts to dissociate the behavioral responses and neurofunctional correlates of P- and A-consciousness and to elucidate how several attentional mechanisms and memory processes are involved in the development of the conscious content.","Repeated Inhalation of Sevoflurane Inhibits Airway Inflammation in an OVA-Induced Mouse Model of Allergic Airway Inflammation
 

Repeated inhalation of sevoflurane (SVF) can benefit asthmatic patients by bronchodilation. However, the impact of repeated inhalation of SVF on allergic airway inflammation has not been clarified. This study was aimed at investigating the effects of repeated inhalation of SVF on airway inflammation in mice.","CproSPB: A Possible Biomarker for Pulmonary Diseases?
 

Background: Detection of surfactant proteins A and D (SPA and SPD) in the serum of patients with pulmonary diseases is thought to reflect an injury of the alveolar epithelial barrier and as such serve as a biomarker for these diseases. However, the data for SPB is limited.
 

Objectives: The aim of this feasibility study was to assess whether immature SPB preproteins might have value as a possible biomarker for pulmonary diseases. 
 

Methods: In serum samples from patients with different chronic lung diseases (interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung cancer, pulmonary hypertension, inflammation, patients on ventilator support; total n 283), CproSPB was measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay based on mouse monoclonal antiCproSPB antibodies. Levels were correlated to lung functional and clinical parameters.
 

Results: The highest CproSPB levels were detected in the serum of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients. In a multivariate analysis, CproSPB levels were able to discriminate IPF patients from patients with all other pulmonary diseases p 0.0001. No significant correlations were found between CproSPB levels and lung function, smoking history, or disease extent.
 

Conclusions: SPB preproteins might serve as a biomarker in pulmonary diseases with alveolar or interstitial damage such as ILDs, especially in IPF. Their role in the long-term monitoring of such diseases has to be clarified further.","Mode of Action: Inhibition of Androgen Receptor Function - Vinclozolin-Induced Malformations in Reproductive Development
 

Vinclozolin is a fungicide that has been shown to cause Leydig cell tumors and atrophy of the accessory sex glands in adult rodents. In addition, exposure of rats during pregnancy causes a pattern of malformations in the male urogenital tract. A wealth of standard toxicological studies and targeted research efforts is available related to this adverse effect, and these were used to evaluate the Human Relevance Framework (HRF) for noncancer health effects.
 

Vinclozolin and two of its metabolites, designated M1 and M2, have been shown to bind and inhibit the function of the rat and human androgen receptor. Other means of interfering with androgen receptor function (e.g., by exposure to the pharmaceutical agent flutamide) lead to similar adverse health outcomes. There is direct in vivo evidence in the rat prostate that androgen dependent gene expression changes occur after exposure to vinclozolin. There are no proposed alternatives to the androgen receptor mediated mode of action. Based on what is known about kinetic and dynamic factors, confidence is high that the animal mode of action (MOA) for vinclozolin-induced malformation of the male reproductive tract is highly plausible in humans.","Deactivation of Anticancer Drug Letrozole to a Carbinol Metabolite by Polymorphic Cytochrome P450 2A6 in Human Liver Microsomes
 

Cytochromes P450 (P450) involved in letrozole metabolism were investigated. Among 13 recombinant P450 forms examined, only P450 2A6 and 3A4 showed activities in transforming letrozole to its carbinol metabolite with small Km and high Vmax values yielding apparent VmaxKm values of 0.48 and 0.24 nl min-1 nmol-1 P450, respectively.
 

The metabolic activities of individual human liver microsomes showed a significant correlation with coumarin 7-hydroxylase activities (P450 2A6 marker) at a letrozole concentration of 0.5 M, while a good correlation was also seen with testosterone 6-hydroxylase activities P450 3A4 marker at 5 M substrate concentration with different inhibition by 8-methoxypsoralen.
 

Significantly low carbinol-forming activities were seen in human liver microsomes from individuals possessing CYP2A644 whole CYP2A6 gene deletion at a letrozole concentration of 0.5 M.
 

A VmaxKm value measured for CYP2A6.7 amino acid substitution type in human liver microsomes, in the presence of antiP450 3A4 antibodies, was approximately sevenfold smaller than that for CYP2A6.1 wildtype.
 

These results demonstrate that P450 2A6 and 3A4 catalyze the conversion of letrozole to its carbinol metabolite in vitro at low and high concentrations of letrozole. Polymorphic variation of CYP2A6 is considered to be relevant to intersubject variation in therapeutic exposure of letrozole.","Risk of Hypersensitivity to Biologic Agents Among Medicare Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis
 

Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) can occur with any of the available biologic agents used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We compared drug-specific risks for HSRs among RA patients enrolled in the US Medicare program.","A Phase I SingleAgent Study of TwiceWeekly ConsecutiveDay Dosing of the Proteasome Inhibitor Carfilzomib in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma or Lymphoma
 

Purpose: Carfilzomib is a next-generation, selective, proteasome inhibitor with clinical activity in relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. The objectives of this phase I study were to establish the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles of escalating doses of carfilzomib in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. 
 

Experimental design: Carfilzomib doses ranging from 1.227 mg/m2 were administered i.v. on 2 consecutive days for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle. Singleagent dose escalation (n=37) was followed by a doseexpansion phase (n=11) that comprised 2 cohorts carfilzomib or carfilzomib dexamethasone. During dose expansion, carfilzomib was administered starting with 20 mg/m2 during the first week (days 1, 2) and then escalated to 27 mg/m2 thereafter.
 

Results: A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached during dose escalation. Dosing in the expansion cohort was well tolerated. Adverse events were manageable and primarily of grade I or II. The main hematologic adverse events of grade III were anemia and thrombocytopenia. Notably, there were no observations of grade III or more peripheral neuropathy. Carfilzomib was cleared rapidly with an elimination half-life of less than 30 minutes but still induced dose-dependent inhibition of the 20S chymotrypsinlike proteasome activity. At doses of 15 to 27 mg/m2, there was evidence of activity among patients with multiple myeloma and with nonHodgkin lymphoma.
 

Conclusions: Escalated dosing of carfilzomib on a schedule of 2 consecutive days for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle was tolerable and showed promising activity. This dose regimen has been selected for ongoing and future clinical studies, including PX171003A1 and the pivotal trial ASPIRE.","Increasing breast reconstruction rates by offering more women a choice
 

Breast reconstruction (BR) following mastectomy for breast cancer is safe and has high rates of patient satisfaction, yet only around 12% of Australian women undergo BR. This study presents BR rates and outcomes from a specialist practice that discusses reconstruction options with all women medically suitable for BR.","Pulsed Radiofrequency Application for the Treatment of Pain Secondary to Sacroiliac Joint Metastases
 

Sacroiliac SI joint pain can result from degeneration, infection, malignancy, and trauma. Patients with metastatic bone pain who do not respond to conventional treatment may need more aggressive neuroinvasive approaches. Recently, pulsed radiofrequency PRF neuromodulation has emerged as a promising treatment alternative for refractory cases of SI joint pain. 

Nevertheless, there is no report on the treatment of pain arising from SI joint metastases with PRF. We are reporting about a 63-year-old woman suffering from buttock pain due to breast cancer metastases in the SI joint. We treated this patient with PRF neuromodulation of the L4S3 primary dorsal rami and lateral branches using a rotating curved needle technique. The patient tolerated the procedures well, without any complications. She experienced about 70% reduction in pain, and pain relief was sustained for 10 months. This result suggests that PRF neuromodulation is a safe, effective treatment for pain from SI joint metastases.","Acroangiodermatitis: Review of the Literature and Report of a Case Associated With Symmetrical Foot Ulcers.
 

Acroangiodermatitis AAD is a rare vasoproliferative disorder, usually of the lower limb, associated with a number of congenital and acquired vascular conditions. Only a few cases have been reported over the last 30 years, mainly in dermatological and plastic surgery journals. We have reviewed the previous literature and present the first case of AAD in a patient who presented to the vascular clinic with chronic venous insufficiency and foot ulcers that were resistant to conventional treatment.","Clinical Features and Surgical Results of Right Atrial Myxoma
 

We retrospectively analyzed 367 patients receiving surgical resection of cardiac myxomas in our center over six years, and analyzed the incidence and surgical results of 28 cases of right atrial myxomas. We also compared the age, gender, and attached sites between left atrial myxoma and right atrial myxoma.","Wetland Information Extraction based on Improved Linear Spectral Mixture Model
 

Automatic extraction of wetland information in farming-pastoral regions is very difficult,because land use types are complex and wetland area is small which leads to serious mixed pixel phenomenon. Aiming at the characteristics and difficulties of wetland remote sensing information extraction in these regions,the NDVI (Normalized Different Vegetation Index) threshold method was used to extract water bodies first. Afterwards, the support vector machine (SVM) was selected to extract wetland information which has removed water. Finally, the meadow component which was decomposed by linear spectral mixture model was amended by the high-resolution satellite image to further extract high coverage,medium coverage and low coverage meadow. The experimental results showed that the overall accuracy was 88% and the Kappa coefficient was 0.83.This method can provide a reference of remote sensing information extraction of wetland for other regions with mixed spectral characteristics.","Smart Pollution Source Tracing via Gradient Tree Boosting Regression
 

Air pollution source tracing, technically known as source apportionment problem, has been an important prerequisite for urban atmospheric pollution prevention and control especially in China where the pollution sources are highly heterogeneous across regions and time.
 

However, effective and reliable source tracing has been a difficult task due to the need for pollution inventory profile which is cost and time consuming to obtain, as well as the need for domain expertise in data analysis and result interpretation.
 

As large amount of historical ambient air pollution especially particulate matter (PM) data, which consists of both its chemical composition and the pollution control conclusions provided by human experts have been accumulated in the past decade, we develop a data-driven, end-to-end Smart Pollution Source Tracing (SPST) model for fully automatic estimation of PM source contributions.
 

The proposed model is based on the Gradient Tree Boosting algorithm which learns an ensemble of regression trees to learn the nonlinear mapping between ambient pollution data and the corresponding pollution source contribution.
 

The SPST model is trained and tested on both synthetic data which has been previously used as a benchmark in other models, as well as the real, 5 cities atmospheric pollution data. Performance evaluation on synthetic data shows significant improvement of SPST over previous source tracing models. SPST also achieves high accuracy on real data, showing its potential to be applied in practice.","Duration Modeling for Arabic Text-to-Speech Synthesis
 

Duration modeling is a fundamental task of prosody generation for Text To Speech (TTS) systems. The objective of this task is to predict the duration of a speech unit from its phonological representation. Duration modeling has a significant influence on the intelligibility and the naturalness of the synthesized speech.
 

This paper presents a Neural Network (NN)-based approach to predict the duration of Arabic phonemes. The developed model utilizes neural networks to map the relation between the phonological features and duration values.","Tomorrow’s World: Voice Recognition has arrived
 

Imagine giving a computer commands by speaking to it, or telling your telephone to phone home and having it dial the number automatically! How about speaking into a small box in English and having the phrase come out in Spanish.

Keyword spotting is one of important topics in speech recognition. The paper presents a model of keyword spotting and the training method of relevant keyword models and anti-words models, then we give a strategy of keyword spotting. Experiment indicates the strategy is effective.","Towards Multiple Pronunciation Generation in Acoustic G2P Conversion Framework
 

Recently an acoustic data-driven grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion approach has been proposed in which the G2P relationship is learned through acoustic data, and the learned relationship together with the orthographic transcription of the word are used to infer pronunciations.
 

This paper extends the acoustic G2P conversion approach and proposes two methods for generating multiple pronunciations to better handle pronunciation variations.
 

-In the first method, multiple pronunciations are generated by using different cost functions at the learning stage to possibly capture different G2P relationships.

-The second method generates multiple pronunciations at the inference stage through N-best decoding.
 

Our experimental studies on Phonebook task in English show that 

a) the first method yields lower average number of pronunciations per word than the second method.

and 

b) both methods, without pronunciation selection or pruning, lead to improvements in the performance at the pronunciation level as well as the speech recognition level.","oRis: Un environnement de simulation interactive multiagents 
 

oRis is a toolkit for interactive simulation: it is both an object-based concurrent programming language and an execution environment. Its features make oRis a generic platform for multi-agent systems (MAS) implementation. It is a dynamically interpreted language, instance-grained which allows the user, during the execution, to observe the MAS, to interact with the agents or the environment and modify them in line.
 

With oRis, a MAS is compounded of agents basically active objects in an environment containing objects, eventually situated in space 2D or 3D and time. oRis offers an homogenous solution for interactions, implemented as method invocation or callback or message passing point-to-point or broadcast, synchronous or asynchronous processing. 
 

oRis offers different ways to manage the execution flows and the scheduler guarantees the equity of the timesharing. oRis is stable and efficient. It has been used in many projects and is integrated in the AReVi virtual reality platform.","A Collective Intelligence-Based System to Improve Cluster Formation in Wireless Sensor Networks
 

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a new type of technology that aspires to provide new capabilities and solutions. Their use is continuing to increase in numerous areas. However, the scarce resources of the sensor nodes ought to be considered, mainly in terms of energy efficiency. As a result, one of the most pressing concerns in WSNs is the development of an energy efficient routing system to extend network lifetime.
 

One way to achieve energy efficiency would be using a clustering technique. In this work, we propose an approach based on computational intelligence to deal with the problem of sensor nodes clustering in a WSN. Thus, the ultimate goal of reducing energy costs is to extend the network lifetime. In this context, a data routing protocol within a WSN is developed using a computational technique.
 

The performance analysis shows that our proposed protocol GALEACHPEGASIS (Genetic Algorithm LEACH PEGASIS) is able to optimize the network lifetime by minimizing energy consumption compared to the well known LEACH protocol.","Study of Urban Traffic State Judgment based on SFLA-FCM Clustering
 

In order to solve the problem of urban traffic state judgment,this paper proposed a novel traffic interval programming method, SFLA-FCM, based on SFLA and FCM.
 

SFLA-FCM used SFLA to replace the iteration process of FCM based on the gradient descent and avoided the disadvantages of local optimality and initialization dependence.Then applied it to a set of real traffic flow data. 

The clustering result shows that this method enjoys good performance in fast and effective distinguishing urban traffic congestion and will contribute to dynamic traffic congestion warning and traffic guidance.","A Novel Control Strategy for Improving the Performance of a Nearly Zero Energy Building
 

This paper deals with one of the most challenging problems in nearly zero energy buildings (nZEBs) of several multifaceted and sometimes contradictory objectives, that is energy management. Specifically, aim of the paper is to propose an integrated control strategy (ICS) based on genetic algorithms that can provide an optimal balance between the objectives of energy saving, comfort of the building residents and maximum exploitation of the generated electric energy by the renewable energy sources through the proper utilization of a battery storage system (BSS).
 

The above can be attained by optimizing a comprehensive cost function that considers the most important factors that may affect the performance of an nZEB, i.e., realtime electricity price, generated/consumed electric energy by each device, user preferences, state-of-charge, and energy price of the BSS, weather forecast and the nZEBs construction characteristics.
 

The outcome of the ICS is the proper task scheduling and control of the electric loads as well as the regulation of the BSS operation so as the nZEBs performance is improved. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ICS are verified in a hardware-in-the-loop system and selective experimental results are presented to demonstrate the operational improvements.",PROLIFIC_PID
